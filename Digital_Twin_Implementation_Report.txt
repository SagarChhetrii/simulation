COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (Answer to Boss's Question)
================================================================================

Hardware Requirements:
  - CPU: Standard laptop (Intel i5/M1 or better) ✓
  - RAM: 8GB (sufficient for current implementation) ✓
  - Storage: ~100MB per area = ~800MB total ✓
  - GPU: Not required ✓

Processing Time Per Area (with 100 vehicles):
  - Network download: 5-15 minutes (depends on OSM API availability)
  - Network conversion: 30 seconds
  - Traffic generation: 10 seconds
  - Simulation run (GUI): 2-3 minutes
  - Simulation run (no GUI): 30 seconds
  ► Total per area: ~15-20 minutes

Total Implementation Time:
  - For 7 remaining areas: ~2-3 hours (sequential)
  - With automation: ~1.5-2 hours
  - With cloud parallelization: ~30-40 minutes

Scalability:
  - Current setup: Laptop sufficient for 8 areas ✓
  - For 20+ areas: Consider cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)
  - For 1000+ vehicles per area: 16GB RAM recommended
  - For city-wide (100+ areas): Cluster computing needed

VEHICLE COUNT EXPLANATION (100 vs 1800)
================================================================================

Initial Implementation (Electronic City):
  - Used: 1800 vehicles
  - Duration: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
  - Insertion rate: Every 2 seconds
  - Calculation: 3600 ÷ 2 = 1800 vehicles

Updated Implementation (Per Boss's Requirement):
  - Using: 100 vehicles per area
  - Duration: 1000 seconds (~16 minutes)
  - Insertion rate: Every 10 seconds
  - Calculation: 1000 ÷ 10 = 100 vehicles
  - Rationale: Faster processing, easier analysis, manageable dataset size
