DIGITAL TWIN PROJECT - QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

STATUS: Proof of Concept Completed ✓

COMPLETED:
  ✓ Electronic City: 94 junctions, 198 roads, 100 vehicles
  ✓ Fully operational simulation with real-time visualization

READY TO SCALE TO:
  • Indiranagar (100 Feet Road, CMH Road)
  • Whitefield (Marathahalli Bridge, ITPL Main Road)
  • Koramangala (Sony World Junction, Sarjapur Road)
  • MG Road (Trinity Circle, Anil Kumble Circle)
  • Jayanagar (Jayanagar 4th Block, South End Circle)
  • Hebbal (Hebbal Flyover, Ballari Road)
  • Yeshwanthpur (Yeshwanthpur Circle, Tumkur Road)

COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (Your Question):
  • Hardware: Current laptop sufficient ✓
  • Time per area: ~15-20 minutes
  • Total for 7 areas: 2-3 hours
  • 100 vehicles per area: Implemented ✓

WHY 100 VEHICLES?
  • Original: 1800 vehicles (1 hour simulation)
  • Updated: 100 vehicles (manageable, faster processing)
  • Can be scaled up as needed

AREA COVERAGE:
  • Electronic City: 1.5 km² (Completed)
  • 7 Additional areas: ~12.6 km² (Ready)
  • Total: ~14.1 km²

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Complete data download for remaining 7 areas
  2. Run simulations for all locations
  3. Integrate with Excel traffic dataset
  4. Generate comparative analysis

TIMELINE: Can complete all 7 areas in next 24-48 hours
